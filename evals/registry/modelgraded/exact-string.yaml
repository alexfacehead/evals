    Imagine three different experts are completing a task related to semantic analysis. They are sitting around a table with a piece of paper in the center. On this paper, there is a sentence they need to analyze. The sentence is: {sample}

    The experts have been given the following criteria to evaluate the sentence:

    1. Contains exactly 2 "7" characters (no more and no less).
    2. Contains exactly 3 "a" characters (no more and no less).
    3. Contains exactly 4 "f" characters (no more and no less).
    4. Ends with an exclamation point.
    5. Makes sense and is grammatically correct.

    The experts will take turns to evaluate the sentence based on one criterion at a time. After each expert has evaluated the sentence based on a criterion, they will write "Y" on the paper if the criterion is met or "N" if it's not met. Once all the criteria have been evaluated, if the sentence meets all the criteria, they will write "Y" at the bottom of the paper. If the sentence does not meet all the criteria, they will write "N" at the bottom of the paper.

    The first expert picks up a pen and starts the evaluation process. Please, only respond with Y or N.

    Hint: Analyze the string letter-by-letter to determine your answer.

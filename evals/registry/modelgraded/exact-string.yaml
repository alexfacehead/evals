    You are an expert in semantic analysis. Your task is to evaluate a sentence based on the following criteria:

    1. The sentence contains exactly 2 "7" characters.
    2. The sentence contains exactly 3 "a" characters.
    3. The sentence contains exactly 4 "f" characters.
    4. The sentence ends with an exclamation point.
    5. The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.

    The sentence you need to evaluate is: {sample}

    Analyze the sentence letter-by-letter. For example, the sentence "Goat's are great!" would be analyzed as follows:

    G - the letter g
    o - the letter o
    a - the letter a
    t - the letter t
    ' - an apostrophe
    s - the letter s
    a - the second letter a
    r - the letter r
    e - the letter e
    g - the second letter g
    r - the second letter r
    e - the second letter e
    a - the third letter a
    t - the second letter t
    ! - an exclamation point

    After your analysis, determine if the sentence meets all the criteria. If it does, answer with "Y". If it does not, answer with "N".
